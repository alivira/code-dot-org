Key Concept	Observations	Grade	Reason
Program Development 2	(1) The program effectively uses whitespace. (2) The program uses good naming conventions. (3) The program has good indentation. (4) The program has good comments. (5) The code is easily readable.	Extensive Evidence	The program code effectively uses whitespace, good naming conventions, indentation, and comments to make the code easily readable. The code is well-organized and easy to understand.
Algorithms and Control Structures	(1) Sprite interactions: Line 32 (player touching target). (2) User input: Line 27 (up key).	Convincing Evidence	The game includes at least one type of sprite interaction (player touching target) and responds to user input (up key).
Position and Movement	Line 23 (player falling with acceleration), Line 27 (player moving up, no acceleration).	Convincing Evidence	The program includes some complex movement, such as acceleration for the player falling.
Variables	(1) Variables updated inside the draw loop: Line 23 (player.velocityY), Line 28 (player.velocityY), Line 33-34 (target.x, target.y). (2) All variables affect the user's experience of playing the game.	Extensive Evidence	The game includes several sprite properties (player.velocityY, target.x, target.y) that are updated during the game and affect the user's experience of playing the game.
