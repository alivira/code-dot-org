Key Concept	Observations	Grade	Reason
Program Development 2	(1) The program effectively uses whitespace. (2) The program uses good naming conventions. (3) The program has good indentation. (4) The program has good comments. (5) The code is easily readable.	Extensive Evidence	The program code effectively uses whitespace, good naming conventions, indentation, and comments to make the code easily readable. The code is well-organized and easy to understand.
Algorithms and Control Structures	(1) Sprite interactions: Line 37 (player touches star), Line 40 (player collides with monster1), Line 41 (player collides with monster2). (2) User input: Line 29 (up key), Line 32 (left key), Line 35 (right key).	Extensive Evidence	The game includes multiple different interactions between sprites (player touching coin, player touching obstacles), responds to multiple types of user input (up, left, and right arrow keys).
Position and Movement	Line 25 (player falling with acceleration), Line 27-30 (monster1 looping, no acceleration), Line 31-34 (monster2 looping, no acceleration), Line 29 (player moving up, no acceleration), Line 32 (player moving left, no acceleration), Line 35 (player moving right, no acceleration).	Convincing Evidence	The program includes some complex movement, such as acceleration for the player falling.
Variables	(1) Variables updated inside the draw loop: Line 25 (player.velocityY), Line 29 (player.velocityY), Line 32 (player.velocityX), Line 35 (player.velocityX), Line 37 (star.x, star.y), Line 40-41 (player position affected by collision). (2) All variables affect the user's experience of playing the game.	Extensive Evidence	The game includes two sprite properties (player.velocityX, player.velocityY) that are updated during the game and affect the user's experience of playing the game.
