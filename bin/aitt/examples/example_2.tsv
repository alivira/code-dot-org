Key Concept	Observations	Grade	Reason
Program Development 2	(1) The program effectively uses whitespace. (2) The program uses good naming conventions. (3) The program has good indentation. (4) The program has good comments. (5) The code is easily readable.	Extensive Evidence	The program code makes good use of whitespace, naming, indentation, and comments. The program is easily readable.
Algorithms and Control Structures	(1) Sprite interactions: Line 37 (player touches target), Line 40 (player collides with obstacleX), Line 41 (player collides with obstacleY). (2) User input: Line 24 (up key), Line 28 (left key), Line 32 (right key).	Extensive Evidence	The game includes multiple different interactions between sprites (player touching coin, player touching obstacles), responds to multiple types of user input (up, left, and right arrow keys).
Position and Movement	Line 18 (player falling with acceleration), Line 21 (obstacleX looping, no acceleration), Line 25 (obstacleY looping, no acceleration), Line 24 (player moving up with acceleration), Line 28 (player moving left with acceleration), Line 32 (player moving right with acceleration).	Extensive Evidence	The program includes several instances of complex movement, such as acceleration of the player in multiple directions (up, down, left, right).
Variables	(1) Variables updated inside draw loop: Line 18 (player.velocityY), Line 21 (obstacleX.x, obstacleX.y), Line 25 (obstacleY.x, obstacleY.y), Line 24 (player.velocityY), Line 28 (player.velocityX), Line 32 (player.velocityX). (2) All variables affect the user's experience of playing the game.	Extensive Evidence	The game includes two sprite properties (player.velocityX, player.velocityY) that are updated during the game and affect the user's experience of playing the game.
