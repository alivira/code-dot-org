Key Concept	Observations	Grade	Reason
Program Development 2	(1) The program effectively uses whitespace, but could benefit from more blank lines to break up long code blocks (lines 3-13). (2) The program uses good naming conventions. (3) The program has good indentation. (4) The program is generally well commented. (5) The code is easily readable.	Convincing Evidence	The program code makes use of whitespace, indentation, and comments. However, it could benefit from more whitespace to break up longer blocks of code.
Algorithms and Control Structures	(1) Sprite interactions: Line 37 (player touches target), Line 40 (player collides with obstacleX), Line 41 (player collides with obstacleY). (2) User input: Line 29 (up key), Line 32 (left key), Line 35 (right key).	Extensive Evidence	The game includes multiple different interactions between sprites (player touching coin, player touching obstacles), responds to multiple types of user input (up, left, and right arrow keys).
Position and Movement	Line 23 (player falling, no acceleration), Line 25 (obstacleX looping, no acceleration), Line 29 (obstacleY looping, no acceleration), Line 30 (player controls up, no acceleration), Line 33 (player controls left, no acceleration), Line 36 (player controls right, no acceleration).	Limited Evidence	The program includes simple movement, such as moving in a straight line.
Variables	(1) Updated variables inside draw loop: Line 23 (player.velocityY), Line 25 (obstacleX.x, obstacleX.y), Line 29 (obstacleY.y, obstacleY.x), Line 30 (player.velocityY), Line 33 (player.velocityX), Line 36 (player.velocityX), Line 37 (target.x, target.y). (2) All variables affect the user's experience of playing the game.	Extensive Evidence	The game includes two sprite properties (player.velocityX, player.velocityY) that are updated during the game and affect the user's experience of playing the game.
