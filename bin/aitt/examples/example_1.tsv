Key Concept	Observations	Grade	Reason
Program Development 2	(1) The program effectively uses whitespace. (2) The program uses good naming conventions. (3) The program has good indentation. (4) The program has many comments, but most are inaccurate. (5) The program is hard to read due to inaccurate comments.	Limited Evidence	The program code has good formatting, indentation and naming. However, many of the comments in the program are inaccurate because the code they describe has not been provided, making the program hard to read.
Algorithms and Control Structures	(1) No sprite interactions. (2) The program does not respond to user input.	No Evidence	The game includes no conditionals. The student's code does not include any sprite interactions or user input handling beyond the starter code.
Position and Movement	No movement generated.	No Evidence	There is no movement in the program. The student's code does not add any movement or position changes to the sprites.
Variables	No variables updated inside draw loop.	No Evidence	No variables or sprite properties are updated.
