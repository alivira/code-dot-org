Program Development 2,"The program code effectively uses whitespace, good naming conventions, indentation and comments to make the code easily readable.","The program code makes use of whitespace, indentation, and comments.",The program code has few comments and does not consistently use formatting such as whitespace and indentation.,The program code does not contain comments and is difficult to read.
Algorithms and Control Structures,"The game includes multiple different interactions between sprites, responds to multiple types of user input (e.g. different arrow keys).",The game includes at least one type of sprite interaction and responds to user input.,The game responds to user input through a conditional.,The game includes no conditionals.
Position and Movement,"Complex movement such as acceleration, moving in a curve, or jumping is included in multiple places in the program.","The program includes some complex movement, such as jumping, acceleration, or moving in a curve.","The program includes simple independent movement, such as a straight line or rotation.","There is no movement in the program, other than direct user control."
Variables,The game includes multiple variables or sprite properties that are updated during the game and affect how the game is played.,The game includes at least one variable or sprite property that is updated during the game and affects the way the game is played,There is at least one variable or sprite property updated in the program.,"There are no variables or sprite properties, or they are not updated."
