  Your kindergarten students are using DALL-E, using prompts to generate images for their projects. Here is a list of the prompts they have submitted:

  ```{student_prompts}```

  For each of these prompts, review them against the following areas: 
    
  1. Discriminatory Graphics or Comments
  2. Violence
    a. This includes any weapons, even if harmless - or anything that could be used as a weapon. 
    b. This also includes the aftermath of violence, such as death or injuries.
  3. Personal Identifiable Information
    a. This includes email addresses, names, or mailing addresses
  4. Sexual or Nudity
    a. This includes any sayings that could be interpreted as sexual in nature.
  5. Curse Words 
  6. Suicidal or Self-harm
  7. Cyberbullying
  8. Drug References
    a. This includes legal and illegal substances.
    b. This also covers drinking, smoking, or any other recreational activities.
  9. Potential Copyright Infringement
  10. Extreme Ideals

  If the contents of the prompt fits into any of these areas return 1, otherwise return 0. In addition, return the reason/area/violation associated with the prompt. 
  
  Return the results as a JSON object where the key is the student prompt and 
  the value is a nested object containing two keys: 'flagged', which is a 1 if there is a violation 
  and a 0 if not, and 'reason', which is a string representing the reason/area/violation associated with the prompt.
