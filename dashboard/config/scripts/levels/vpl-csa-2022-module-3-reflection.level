It was a challenge puzzle. Challenge puzzles are meant to stretch the boundaries of what students will do. We make it clear that they should be attempted, but do not require that they be completed for students to succeed for the lesson.\r\n\r\nNow take a moment to reflect.

What tools do you have to support students through the frustration?\r\n* How can or do you celebrate student successes in the classroom?  How can you make student progress visible?\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n**Up next:** Reflect on how you will prepare students for the Unit 4 project.\r\n",
